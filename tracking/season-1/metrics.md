# Season 1 Metrics Tracker

**Purpose:** Track performance bands and apply decision policy (one change per week)
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-26

---

## Draft Metric Bands (First 8 Weeks)

**LOCKED v1:** These bands are locked for the first 8 weeks. Refine after 4 uploads if needed (requires Plan v3 version bump).

### CTR (Click-Through Rate)

- **Low:** < 2%
- **Okay:** 2–5%
- **Good:** > 5%

### Early Retention (First 30–60 seconds)

- **Weak:** Big drop before 60s
- **Okay:** Stabilizes after early hook

### Average View Duration (AVD)

- **Weak:** < 30% of video
- **Okay:** 30–45%
- **Strong:** > 45%

---

## Decision Policy (One Change Per Week)

**LOCKED:** Change only **one major variable** per week to isolate impact.

### Decision Matrix

1. **Strong retention + weak CTR** → Change **thumbnail** first
2. **Weak retention early** → Change **hook structure** (not packaging)
3. **Both weak** → Adjust topic framing/angle (next episode)

**Rule:** Do NOT change multiple variables simultaneously (e.g., don't change thumbnail AND hook in same week).

## Refinement After 4 Uploads

**Trigger:** After EP004 published and metrics stabilize (e.g., 7 days post-publish)

**Review:**
- Are the draft bands (CTR, retention, AVD) accurate for this channel?
- Do the decision policy rules make sense based on observed patterns?

**Action:**
- If bands need adjustment, document rationale and propose Plan v3 update
- Get Chris approval before updating plan

## Notes

- These are not promises or targets; they are guardrails to prevent random changes
- Purpose: Maintain packaging discipline and one-change-per-week rule
- Metrics inform decisions, but decisions must be deliberate and isolated
