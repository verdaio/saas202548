## Correction Categories

### Critical Corrections (Re-upload or prominent correction)

Critical = numbers, dates, causality, safety implications, or thesis-central claims that are incorrect.

**Action:** Update description + pinned comment with correction and source. If critical to video integrity, consider re-upload.

### Narrative Corrections (Update description/comment)

Narrative = non-critical details, minor factual errors that don't affect thesis.

**Action:** Update description or pinned comment with correction and source.

## Notes

- All corrections must include a source verifying the correct information
- Transparency is critical: always acknowledge and correct errors publicly
- Log ALL corrections, even minor ones, to track patterns
- If multiple corrections occur for a single episode, review research SOP compliance
