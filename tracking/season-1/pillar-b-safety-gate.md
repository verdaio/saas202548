## Pillar B Safe Subset Ordering (NEW, LOCKED)

**Start with lower-defamation-risk, high-primary-source cases first:**

### Tier 1: Safe Subset (Start Here)

1. **Target Canada** — Supply chain/data collapse
   - **Risk:** Low (corporate failure, well-documented)
   - **Sources:** Court filings, credible business journalism, public post-mortems

2. **Hershey ERP Peak Season Failure**
   - **Risk:** Low (operational failure, technical case study)
   - **Sources:** Industry reports, company statements, supply chain literature

3. **MoviePass Pricing Math Failure**
   - **Risk:** Low (business model failure, well-documented)
   - **Sources:** Financial filings, business journalism, public statements

4. **Quibi Product-Market Mismatch**
   - **Risk:** Low (recent, well-documented, no criminal implications)
   - **Sources:** Journalism, company statements, industry analysis

5. **Nokia / BlackBerry Incumbency Case Studies**
   - **Risk:** Low-Medium (requires careful sourcing, avoid speculation about executive motives)
   - **Sources:** "Losing the Signal" book, journalism, market data

### Tier 2: Higher-Risk Topics (Defer Later in Pillar)

**Defer these until Safe Subset proven and QA discipline strong:**

- **Boeing 737 MAX**
  - **Risk:** High (regulatory, safety implications, criminal investigations)
  - **Sources:** FAA reports, congressional testimony, NTSB findings, credible journalism
  - **Language:** Extreme care with causality and motive

- **Theranos**
  - **Risk:** High (criminal fraud case, ongoing legal issues)
  - **Sources:** Court documents, "Bad Blood" book, regulatory filings
  - **Language:** Stick to documented facts, no speculation

- **WeWork**
  - **Risk:** Medium-High (manageable but requires careful language)
  - **Sources:** Financial filings, "The Cult of We" book, journalism
  - **Language:** Avoid motive speculation, stick to operational/financial facts

---

## High-Risk Language Checklist (REQUIRED)

**Before publish, ALL Pillar B episodes must pass this checklist:**

- [ ] **No motive speculation** (e.g., avoid "they knew" or "they lied" without documents)
- [ ] **No accusations without documents** (stick to what's in court filings, regulatory reports, or authoritative sources)
- [ ] **Causal claims only if supported by authoritative sources** (e.g., "The FAA report stated X caused Y" not "X caused Y")
- [ ] **Clear "reported/according to" phrasing and scope** (e.g., "According to [Source], X happened" not "X happened")
- [ ] **Avoid absolutes** (e.g., "appeared to," "seemed to," "was reported as" instead of "was," "did," "caused")
- [ ] **No editorializing or judgment** (stick to facts and documented outcomes)

**Examples:**

| ❌ Risky Language | ✅ Safe Language |
|------------------|-----------------|
| "Boeing executives knew the MCAS system was dangerous" | "FAA reports indicated that Boeing's internal communications raised concerns about the MCAS system" |
| "Elizabeth Holmes lied to investors" | "Court documents showed that Holmes made claims about Theranos's capabilities that were not supported by test results" |
| "WeWork was a fraud" | "WeWork's business model faced significant scrutiny from investors and analysts regarding profitability projections" |

## Notes

- Gate is not optional; it protects channel reputation and prevents premature high-risk content
- Safe subset ordering builds confidence and QA muscle before tackling higher-risk topics
- Chris review is mandatory; no exceptions
- If a Pillar B episode fails review, return to Logistics pillar and strengthen QA before retrying
