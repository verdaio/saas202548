## Risk Notes & Weaknesses

### Weakly Supported / Estimate-Based Claims:
1. **"25 million packages daily"** — Outline uses this, but 2024 data shows 22.4 million. Script should use the accurate 2024 figure [S1].
2. **"125,000 vehicles"** — 2024 data shows ~135,000. Script should update [S2].
3. **"5.5 billion miles/year"** — This is packages, not miles. Actual miles: 3.5 billion [S3]. Script needs correction.
4. **"2024 dynamic upgrade"** — Dynamic routing was 2020-2021, not 2024 [S12]. Script must correct timeline.
5. **"30,000 route calculations per minute"** — This figure does NOT appear in sources; if used, must be flagged as unverified or removed.
6. **"350,000 more packages delivered per year"** — This figure not confirmed in primary sources; treat as estimate or remove.

### Strong, Well-Supported Claims:
- Development timeline (2003-2016)
- $250 million investment
- 100M miles, 10M gallons fuel, 100K metric tons CO2 savings
- 90% right turns
- "Beat the Computer" anecdote
- Combinatorics / atoms comparison
