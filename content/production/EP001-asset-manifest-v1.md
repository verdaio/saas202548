## Risk Notes

### High-Risk Assets (Verify Carefully):
- **UPS-branded footage:** If using press kit materials, verify usage rights
- **Music:** Ensure license covers YouTube monetization (if applicable)
- **Stock footage:** Confirm editorial vs. commercial use rights

### Fallback Plan:
- If stock footage unavailable: Use self-shot alternatives or on-screen text
- If graphics too complex: Simplify to static images with narration
- If music licensing unclear: Use YouTube Audio Library (free, pre-cleared)
