**Episode:** EP001 - How UPS Turned Routing Into a Machine
**Created:** 2025-12-25
**Version:** v1
**Target Length:** 15-20 minutes

---

## Pacing Assumptions

### Words Per Minute (WPM):
- **Conservative (Slow, Deliberate):** 140 WPM
- **Moderate (Conversational):** 150 WPM
- **Brisk (Efficient, Not Rushed):** 160 WPM

**Recommended WPM for this episode:** 150 WPM (conversational pace that allows for emphasis and pauses)

### Target Duration Breakdown:
- **Minimum (15 minutes):** 2,100 words at 140 WPM
- **Target (17-18 minutes):** 2,550-2,700 words at 150 WPM
- **Maximum (20 minutes):** 3,200 words at 160 WPM

**Current Script Word Count:** ~2,480 words (estimated from draft)

**Estimated Duration at 150 WPM:** 2,480 ÷ 150 = **16.5 minutes**

**Status:** ✓ Within target range

## Read-Through Procedure

### Pre-Read Setup:
1. **Print the script** (double-spaced, large font) OR display on large monitor
2. **Set up recording environment:**
   - Quiet room
   - Microphone positioned correctly
   - Water nearby
   - Timer/stopwatch ready
3. **Warm up:**
   - Read a few paragraphs out loud to settle into voice
   - Practice any tricky words or phrases (e.g., "On-Road Integrated Optimization and Navigation")

---

### First Read-Through (Discovery Read):

**Goal:** Get a feel for the script; identify problem areas; rough timing.

**Process:**
1. Read the entire script out loud at a natural, conversational pace
2. **Do not stop** for mistakes or stumbles — power through
3. Use a timer: Start at "Every day, UPS delivers..." and stop at "Thanks for watching. Take care."
4. Mark the script as you read:
   - 🟢 Green: Flows well, feels natural
   - 🟡 Yellow: Awkward phrasing, tongue-twister, unclear
   - 🔴 Red: Stumbled badly, confusing, needs rewrite

**Record the following:**
- Total time: _____ minutes _____ seconds
- Sections that felt too long: _____________________
- Sections that felt too short: _____________________
- Words/phrases that were hard to say: _____________________

---

### Second Read-Through (Timing Read):

**Goal:** Time each section individually; identify pacing issues.

**Process:**
1. Read each section separately
2. Time each section with a stopwatch
3. Record actual times in the table above (see "Actual Time" column)
4. Compare actual times to target times
5. Identify sections that need trimming or expanding

**Decision Rules:**
- **Section is >30 seconds over target:** TRIM — remove non-essential words, tighten sentences
- **Section is >30 seconds under target:** EXPAND — add detail, examples, or transitions (optional; under is often okay)
- **Section is within ±30 seconds of target:** PASS — leave as-is

---

### Third Read-Through (Performance Read):

**Goal:** Read as if recording the final take; focus on delivery, emphasis, pauses.

**Process:**
1. Read with full performance energy (not just reading, but *narrating*)
2. Pay attention to:
   - Natural pauses (commas, periods, section breaks)
   - Emphasis on key numbers/facts
   - Tone shifts (e.g., skeptical drivers vs. triumphant results)
3. Mark any spots where you'd want to add a pause or emphasis in post-production

**Record:**
- Total time: _____ minutes _____ seconds
- Spots where pauses would enhance delivery: _____________________
- Spots where emphasis/tone shift is critical: _____________________

## Revision Process

### If Revisions Are Needed:

1. **Make edits to the script** based on read-through findings
2. **Update word count** in the pacing table above
3. **Perform a "confirmation read"** — read only the revised sections to ensure they flow
4. **Re-time the full script** if major changes were made
5. **Repeat until script is within target range and feels natural**

### Logging Changes:
Document all script revisions:
- Date: _____________________
- Sections revised: _____________________
- Reason: _____________________
- Word count change: _____ words added/removed
- New total time: _____ minutes

## Pacing Tips for Performance

### Speed Control:
- **Don't rush numbers** — listeners need time to absorb stats like "6.7 × 10^198"
- **Pause after key facts** — let impactful statements breathe (e.g., "More routes than atoms in the universe.")
- **Slow down for complexity** — technical sections (how ORION works) should be slightly slower
- **Speed up for momentum** — narrative sections (building ORION, driver stories) can move faster

### Emphasis Patterns:
- **Numbers:** Say them clearly and with slight emphasis (e.g., "one HUNDRED million miles")
- **Key terms:** First mention of ORION, DIAD, traveling salesman problem — pronounce carefully
- **Contrast:** When comparing (left turn vs. right turn), use tone to differentiate

### Pauses:
- **Micro-pause (1 beat):** After commas, between clauses
- **Short pause (2 beats):** After sentences, before new thoughts
- **Medium pause (3-4 beats):** Between sections, after big reveals
- **Long pause (5+ beats):** After cold open (before Section 1), before CTA

### Energy Curve:
- **Cold Open:** High energy, hook the viewer
- **Section 1-2:** Moderate-high, build curiosity
- **Section 3:** Moderate, explain clearly (don't overwhelm)
- **Section 4:** Moderate-high, fun/surprising (right turn rule)
- **Section 5:** Warm, human connection ("Beat the Computer")
- **Section 6:** High, triumphant (results)
- **Recap:** Reflective, calm
- **CTA:** Warm, inviting (not salesy)

## Final Checklist Before Recording

- [ ] Script has been read aloud at least 3 times
- [ ] All awkward phrases have been rewritten
- [ ] Timing is within 15-20 minute target
- [ ] Difficult words/phrases have been practiced
- [ ] Emphasis and pause marks are noted in script
- [ ] Backup copy of script saved (in case recording session requires live edits)
- [ ] Water is ready (hydration prevents dry mouth during recording)
- [ ] Mic check completed (test recording, playback to check levels)

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "The script feels too long, but I'm already at target word count"
**Cause:** Reading too slowly or adding unnecessary pauses
**Fix:** Try reading at 160 WPM (slightly brisker); trim filler words ("actually," "really," "just")

### "The script feels rushed"
**Cause:** Packing too much into a short time window
**Fix:** Identify 2-3 low-priority facts and remove them; prioritize clarity over completeness

### "I keep stumbling on the same phrase"
**Cause:** Awkward word order or tongue-twister
**Fix:** Rewrite the phrase — if you can't say it smoothly in 3 tries, the viewers won't parse it easily either

### "A section feels boring when I read it"
**Cause:** Too many stats in a row, or lack of narrative tension
**Fix:** Add a question, a human element, or a contrasting idea to break up monotony

## Post-Production Timing Notes

### Remember:
- **Narration time ≠ Final video time**
- Final video will include:
  - B-roll footage (some sections may have voiceover over long B-roll sequences)
  - Graphics/animations (may extend time slightly if VO pauses for visual)
  - Music and sound design
  - Intro/outro (if applicable)

### Rule of Thumb:
- If narration is **16.5 minutes**, expect final video to be **17-19 minutes** after adding production elements

### If Final Video Runs Long:
- Trim B-roll dwell times (show graphics for 5 seconds instead of 8)
- Tighten transitions between sections
- Remove redundant visuals

### If Final Video Runs Short:
- Extend B-roll sequences
- Add breathing room to graphics (let stats sit on screen longer)
- Include brief intro/outro animations

## Appendix: Word Count Tool

To get an exact word count for each section:

### Manual Method:
1. Copy section text into a word processor (MS Word, Google Docs)
2. Use built-in word count tool (usually under Tools or Review menu)
3. Record count in table above

### Command-Line Method (Mac/Linux):
```bash
# Count words in a text file
wc -w filename.md

# Count words in a specific section (copy section to temp file first)
echo "Section text here" | wc -w
```

### Online Tools:
- WordCounter.net
- CharacterCountOnline.com

**Next Steps:**
1. Perform first read-through and fill in "Actual Word Count" column
2. Identify problem areas
3. Make revisions if needed
4. Perform confirmation read
5. Approve script for recording
