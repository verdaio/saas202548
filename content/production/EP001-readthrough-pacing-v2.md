## Target Pacing by Section

| Section | Target Time | Target Words (150 WPM) | Script v2 Actual Words | Estimated Time | Status | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------------------------|------------------------|----------------|--------|-------|
| **Cold Open** | 0:00 - 0:45 | 110-115 | ~85 | ~34s | ⚠️ Short | May run faster; acceptable for hook |
| **Section 1: Scale** | 0:45 - 4:00 | 485-490 | ~370 | ~150s (2:30) | ⚠️ Short | Tightened in v2; check pacing |
| **Section 2: Building ORION** | 4:00 - 8:00 | 595-600 | ~380 | ~150s (2:30) | ⚠️ Short | Compressed; may need slower delivery |
| **Section 3: How ORION Works** | 8:00 - 11:30 | 520-525 | ~390 | ~160s (2:40) | ✓ Good | Added example; pacing improved |
| **Section 4: Right Turn Rule** | 11:30 - 14:30 | 445-450 | ~320 | ~130s (2:10) | ⚠️ Short | Best section; likely faster delivery |
| **Section 5: Human Side** | 14:30 - 17:00 | 370-375 | ~310 | ~125s (2:05) | ✓ Good | Human story flows naturally |
| **Section 6: Results** | 17:00 - 18:30 | 220-225 | ~210 | ~85s (1:25) | ✓ Good | v2 added breathing room |
| **Section 7: Recap** | 18:30 - 19:30 | 148-150 | ~210 | ~85s (1:25) | ✓ Good | More conversational in v2 |
| **CTA** | 19:30 - 20:00 | 73-75 | ~100 | ~40s | ✓ Good | No change from v1 |
| **TOTAL** | **15.5-16.0 min** | **~2,320-2,350** | **~2,350** | **~15.5 min** | **✓ ON TARGET** | v2 well-paced |

## Cut List (If Over 16:00)

If the recording runs long, cut in this priority order:

### Tier 1 Cuts (Remove First — Least Impact):
1. **Section 1 (~line 58):** "Think about that. You could spend the entire age of the universe trying routes, and you still wouldn't find the perfect one."
   - **Saves:** ~10 seconds
   - **Impact:** LOW — reinforces point but not essential

2. **Section 6 (~line 268):** "By 2015, just two years after launch, ORION had already saved more than $320 million. The system had paid for itself."
   - **Saves:** ~8 seconds
   - **Impact:** LOW — ROI is already clear from $300M annual savings stat

3. **Section 4 (~line 201-203):** Mythbusters reference: "You might think, 'Does this actually work?' Mythbusters tested it. They found that avoiding left turns saved fuel, even when the total distance was greater."
   - **Saves:** ~12 seconds
   - **Impact:** LOW — third-party validation is nice but not critical

**Total Tier 1 Cuts:** ~30 seconds

### Tier 2 Cuts (If Still Over — Moderate Impact):
4. **Section 3 (~line 143-145):** Atlanta driver example: "Let's say you're a driver in Atlanta. You've got 120 stops. ORION knows which packages are time-sensitive. It knows which stops are businesses that close at 5. It knows where traffic slows down at noon."
   - **Saves:** ~15 seconds
   - **Impact:** MODERATE — concrete example aids clarity but can cut if needed

5. **Section 2 (~line 105-107):** Team growth: "The team grew. Five people became thirty. Then fifty. Eventually, over seven hundred."
   - **Saves:** ~8 seconds
   - **Impact:** MODERATE — impressive stat but not core to narrative

**Total Tier 2 Cuts:** ~23 seconds

### Tier 3 Cuts (Last Resort — Higher Impact):
6. **Section 5 (~line 236-238):** Driver's reaction: "He still doesn't credit ORION. To him, it's just another input, alongside his intuition. And maybe that's the point."
   - **Saves:** ~10 seconds
   - **Impact:** MODERATE-HIGH — good philosophical ending to section but can trim

**DO NOT CUT:**
- Any numeric claims with source markers
- "Beat the Computer" story (core human element)
- Right-turn explanation (key insight)
- Cold open hook (critical for retention)

## Read-Through Procedure (Script v2)

### Pre-Read Setup:
1. Print script double-spaced OR display on large monitor
2. Water nearby
3. Timer ready
4. Mark breathing points and emphasis in advance

### First Read-Through (Discovery):
**Goal:** Feel for flow; identify problem areas
1. Read entire script out loud at natural pace
2. Do NOT stop for mistakes
3. Mark:
   - 🟢 Green: Flows well
   - 🟡 Yellow: Awkward/stumble
   - 🔴 Red: Definitely needs rewrite
4. Record total time

### Second Read-Through (Performance):
**Goal:** Test delivery as if recording
1. Read with full performance energy
2. Note sections that feel rushed or dragged
3. Record total time
4. Compare to target (15.5 min)

### Third Read-Through (Finalize):
**Goal:** Lock delivery choices
1. Mark all pauses, emphasis, tone shifts
2. Confirm any last edits
3. Record final time
4. If within 15:00-16:00, PASS

## Pacing Tips (Script v2 Specific)

### Speed Control:
- **Sections 2-3:** Deliberately slow down — these were compressed in v2 and may feel rushed
- **Section 4:** Can move faster — most engaging section, natural energy
- **Section 6:** v2 improved pacing; use "Let me break it down" as breathing point

### Emphasis Patterns:
- **Numbers:** Clear and deliberate (e.g., "22 million packages")
- **Pattern Interrupts:** Pause slightly before questions ("What does this look like in practice?")
- **Key Terms:** First mention of ORION, traveling salesman problem, DIAD

### Pauses (v2-Specific):
- After "It starts with a problem so big, it took ten years to solve." (beat before Section 1)
- After "What does this look like in practice?" (1-beat pause, then Atlanta example)
- After "Let me break it down." (1-beat pause before stats)
- After "That's the machine behind the machine." (2-beat pause before CTA)

## Post-Recording Analysis

After recording, evaluate:

### Timing:
- [ ] Total time within 15:00-16:30?
- [ ] Any section run >30s over/under target?
- [ ] Pacing felt natural (not rushed/dragged)?

### Clarity:
- [ ] All numbers clear and audible?
- [ ] Pattern interrupts effective?
- [ ] No major stumbles or re-takes?

### Energy:
- [ ] Cold open engaging?
- [ ] Mid-video energy maintained (8-12 min mark)?
- [ ] CTA warm and inviting?

### Action Items:
- If over 16:30: Apply Tier 1 cuts
- If under 14:30: Slow down delivery or expand transitions
- If 15:00-16:30: APPROVED for production
