# EP001: Recording Test Plan (v1)

**Episode:** EP001 - How UPS Turned Routing Into a Machine
**Script Version:** v2 (~2,350 words)
**Target Duration:** 15.5 minutes (15:00-16:30 acceptable)
**Created:** 2025-12-25

---

## Purpose

This recording test serves three critical functions:

1. **Timing verification:** Confirm the script fits within the 15-16 minute window at natural delivery pace
2. **Speakability check:** Identify awkward phrases, tongue-twisters, or unclear transitions that need editing
3. **Energy calibration:** Establish the right tone and delivery style before final production

**Pass Criteria:**
- ✅ Total runtime: 15:00-16:30
- ✅ Fewer than 10 major stumbles (restarts, mispronunciations, or flow breaks)
- ✅ All numeric claims delivered clearly and audibly
- ✅ Energy feels consistent (no major dips in engagement)

## Pre-Recording Setup Checklist

### Environment:
- [ ] Quiet room (no HVAC noise, traffic, or background sounds)
- [ ] Door closed, phone silenced
- [ ] "Do Not Disturb" sign posted (if shared space)
- [ ] Test for echo (clap test — should be minimal reverb)

### Equipment:
- [ ] Microphone connected and recognized by recording software
- [ ] Mic positioned 4-6 inches from mouth, slightly off-axis (reduces plosives)
- [ ] Pop filter installed (if available)
- [ ] Headphones connected for monitoring (optional but recommended)

### Software/Levels:
- [ ] Recording app open (Audacity, Adobe Audition, or preferred DAW)
- [ ] Input levels set: aim for -12dB to -6dB peak (leaves headroom, avoids clipping)
- [ ] Test recording: record 10 seconds, play back, confirm clarity
- [ ] Backup enabled (auto-save or redundant recording)

### Script Prep:
- [ ] Script v2 printed double-spaced OR displayed on large monitor at comfortable reading distance
- [ ] Pencil/pen ready for marking fixes
- [ ] Water nearby (room temperature, no ice — reduces mouth noise)
- [ ] Breathing points marked (use `/` or `||` in script margins)

## Recording Procedure

### Step 1: Warm-Up (5 minutes)
1. **Vocal warm-up:**
   - Hum scales or read a paragraph from another text out loud
   - Focus on clear enunciation and relaxed delivery
2. **Practice the first 30 seconds** (Cold Open) three times to settle into the rhythm
3. **Mental prep:** Remind yourself of the target delivery style (see below)

---

### Step 2: Full Read-Through (Do NOT Stop)

**Objective:** Read the entire script from start to finish at natural pace, as if recording for final production.

**Key Instructions:**
- **Do NOT stop for mistakes.** If you stumble, pause briefly and continue. Mark the issue on your script but keep going.
- **Aim for conversational delivery:** Calm, precise, but not robotic. Imagine explaining this to a curious friend.
- **Pause at section breaks:** 1-2 seconds between sections for breathing room.
- **Read numbers carefully:** "22 million" (pause) "packages," not "twenty-two-million-packages" (too fast).
- **Maintain energy:** Sections 1-2 should feel engaging; Section 4 (right turns) should feel like the "aha!" moment; Section 6 should feel triumphant but not overhyped.

**What to Mark During Read:**
- ⭐ **Stumbles:** Any word/phrase you restart, mispronounce, or trip over
- 🟡 **Awkward phrasing:** Sentences that feel clunky or unnatural
- 🔴 **Clarity issues:** Numbers or terms that feel unclear or rushed
- ⏱️ **Pacing issues:** Sections that felt too fast or too slow

---

### Step 3: Immediate Post-Read Analysis (10 minutes)

**Do this IMMEDIATELY after finishing the read (while it's fresh):**

1. **Stop the recording and note the total time.**
2. **Listen back to the first 2 minutes** (Cold Open + Section 1 start).
   - Did the hook feel engaging?
   - Were the numbers clear?
   - Any pacing issues?
3. **Listen back to Section 4** (Right Turn Rule, ~11:40-14:30).
   - This is the centerpiece — did it feel compelling?
   - Any stumbles on key explanations?
4. **Listen back to the CTA** (~19:30-20:00).
   - Did it feel warm and inviting (not salesy)?

**Fill out the Recording Test Log** (see template) with:
- Total runtime
- Major stumbles (line numbers)
- Awkward phrasing (line numbers)
- Energy notes (which sections dragged or felt rushed)

---

## Target Delivery Style

**Tone:** Calm, curious, precise
- **NOT:** Overly enthusiastic, "YouTube voice," or promotional
- **YES:** NPR/podcast style, conversational but polished

**Pacing:** Deliberate without dragging
- **Target:** 150 WPM average
- **Slow down for:** Numbers, key terms (ORION, traveling salesman problem), pattern interrupts (questions)
- **Speed up slightly for:** Transitions, recap sections (if they feel natural)

**Energy Curve:**
- **Cold Open:** Medium-high (hook the viewer)
- **Section 1:** Medium (establish stakes)
- **Section 2-3:** Medium (building context)
- **Section 4:** Medium-high (the "aha!" moment — right turns)
- **Section 5:** Medium (human story)
- **Section 6:** Medium-high (results)
- **Section 7 + CTA:** Medium (warm close, no hard sell)

**Pauses:**
- After questions: 1 beat (e.g., "What does this look like in practice?" → pause → "Let's say you're a driver in Atlanta...")
- After big stats: 1 beat (e.g., "6.7 × 10^198 possible routes" → pause → "That's more combinations...")
- Between sections: 2 beats

## Common Issues and Fixes

### Issue: Running Too Long (>16:30)
**Likely Causes:**
- Pausing too long between sentences
- Over-enunciating or speaking too slowly
- Adding ad-libs or extra words

**Fixes:**
- Tighten pauses (1 beat instead of 2)
- Read at slightly faster pace (test in 30-second bursts)
- If still over, apply Tier 1 cuts (see Pacing v2 for cut list)

### Issue: Running Too Short (<15:00)
**Likely Causes:**
- Rushing through sentences
- Skipping pauses or breathing points
- Swallowing numbers or key terms

**Fixes:**
- Slow down delivery, especially on numbers
- Add deliberate pauses after questions and key stats
- Re-read sections that felt rushed

### Issue: Stumbles on Specific Sections
**Common Trouble Spots (from Script v2 analysis):**
- Section 1, Line 58: "6.7 × 10^198" (practice saying "six point seven times ten to the one hundred ninety-eighth")
- Section 4, Line 201-203: Mythbusters reference (long sentence — break into two breaths)
- Section 6, Line 268: Multiple stats in sequence (slow down, pause between each)

**Fix:**
- Mark the line in your script
- Practice the phrase 3-5 times before re-recording
- If still awkward, flag for script edit

### Issue: Energy Dip Mid-Video
**Common Dip Zone:** Section 3 (How ORION Works, ~8:00-11:30)
**Fix:**
- Take a 30-second break before Section 3
- Drink water
- Re-read the section with slightly more energy (as if explaining to someone who's genuinely curious)

## Marking System (On Your Script)

Use these symbols during the read:

- **⭐** = Major stumble (restart required)
- **🟡** = Minor awkwardness (note but don't stop)
- **🔴** = Clarity issue (number unclear, term mispronounced)
- **⏱️** = Pacing issue (felt rushed or dragged)
- **✓** = Felt great (mark sections that flowed well for reference)

**Example:**
```
Line 58: "Think about that. You could spend the entire age of the universe..."
         ⭐ (stumbled on "entire age")
         🟡 (phrase felt awkward — consider cutting)
```

## Next Steps (After PASS)

1. **Lock Script v2** (no further changes unless critical error found)
2. **Acquire MVP Assets** (see Asset Manifest v1):
   - Source free stock footage (MVP-001, MVP-004, MVP-011)
   - Schedule self-shoot day (MVP-002, MVP-003, MVP-007, MVP-010, MVP-012)
   - Create MVP graphics (MVP-005, MVP-006, MVP-008, MVP-009) OR outsource
3. **Schedule Final Recording:**
   - Use same setup as test
   - Record in 5-minute sections (allows for retakes without full re-read)
   - Keep water, marked script, and backup recording enabled
