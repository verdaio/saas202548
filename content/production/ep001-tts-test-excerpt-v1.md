## Test Narration

Every day, UPS delivers 22 million packages. Behind each one is a quiet decision. Which truck. Which route. Which turn.

So how do you route over 130,000 vehicles to millions of addresses every single day... without everything falling apart?

Today, we're looking at the invisible machine that makes this work. A system called ORION. On-Road Integrated Optimization and Navigation. And the surprising rule that says: don't turn left.

It starts with a problem so big, it took ten years to solve.

Imagine you're a UPS driver. You have 120 stops today. How many different ways could you sequence those stops?

The answer? A number with almost 200 digits. More possible routes than there are atoms in the observable universe.

Think about that. You could spend the entire age of the universe trying routes, and you still wouldn't find the perfect one.

This is called the traveling salesman problem. The puzzle: find the shortest route that visits every stop exactly once. It's one of the classic challenges in computer science.

And at the scale UPS operates — billions of packages a year, billions of miles driven — it's not just a math puzzle. It's the difference between profit and loss.
