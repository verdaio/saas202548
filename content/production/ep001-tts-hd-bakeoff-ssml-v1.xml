      Every day, <say-as interpret-as="characters">UPS</say-as> delivers 22 million packages. Behind each one is a quiet decision. Which truck. Which route. Which turn.
      <break time="250ms"/>

      So how do you route over 130,000 vehicles to millions of addresses every single day... without everything falling apart?
      <break time="250ms"/>

      Today, we're looking at the invisible machine that makes this work. A system called <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈoʊɹaɪən">ORION</phoneme>. On-Road Integrated Optimization and Navigation. And the surprising rule that says: don't turn left.
      <break time="250ms"/>

      It starts with a problem so big, it took ten years to solve.
      <break time="250ms"/>

      Imagine you're a <say-as interpret-as="characters">UPS</say-as> driver. You have 120 stops today. How many different ways could you sequence those stops?
      <break time="250ms"/>

      The answer? A number with almost 200 digits. More possible routes than there are atoms in the observable universe.
      <break time="250ms"/>

      Think about that. You could spend the entire age of the universe trying routes, and you still wouldn't find the perfect one.
      <break time="250ms"/>

      This is called the traveling salesman problem. The puzzle: find the shortest route that visits every stop exactly once. It's one of the classic challenges in computer science.
      <break time="250ms"/>

      And at the scale <say-as interpret-as="characters">UPS</say-as> operates — billions of packages a year, billions of miles driven — it's not just a math puzzle. It's the difference between profit and loss.
