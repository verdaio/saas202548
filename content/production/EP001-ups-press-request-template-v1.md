Dear UPS Media Relations Team,

I am producing an educational video exploring the history and impact of UPS's ORION (On-Road Integrated Optimization and Navigation) routing system. The video will focus on the technical innovation, operational challenges, and environmental benefits of algorithmic route optimization in logistics.

This project is intended for educational purposes, with the goal of explaining complex optimization problems to a general audience. I am writing to request permission to use UPS media assets and to ask for any publicly available materials related to ORION.

### Requested Assets:

If available, I would greatly appreciate access to the following:

1. **B-Roll Footage:**
   - UPS delivery vehicles in operation (highway, urban, residential settings)
   - Distribution center operations (optional)
   - Driver-facing technology (DIAD device, if publicly available)

2. **Graphics and Imagery:**
   - ORION system diagrams or screenshots (if approved for media use)
   - Maps or visualizations showing route optimization
   - Any public infographics related to ORION's environmental impact

3. **Brand Guidelines:**
   - UPS brand and logo usage guidelines
   - Color palette and typography specifications
   - Any restrictions on use of UPS trademarks in educational content

4. **Historical or Technical Materials:**
   - Press releases or fact sheets related to ORION (2013 launch, 2015 results, etc.)
   - Any publicly available case studies or white papers
   - Archival footage of pre-ORION delivery operations (if available)

### Usage Details:

- **Purpose:** Educational video explaining algorithmic optimization in logistics
- **Platform:** [YouTube / Online Education Platform / Specify]
- **Format:** ~15-20 minute explainer video
- **Audience:** General public interested in technology and operations research
- **Tone:** Factual, educational, non-promotional
- **Monetization:** [Specify: Non-monetized / Ad-supported / Sponsored / etc.]

### Licensing and Attribution:

I am committed to:
- Proper attribution of all UPS materials used
- Compliance with UPS brand guidelines
- Editorial accuracy (all claims will be fact-checked and cited)
- Providing UPS with a preview of the final video before publication (if requested)

If UPS media assets are not available for this purpose, I will use third-party stock footage and self-created graphics that reference UPS in a nominative fair use context.

### Timeline:

- **Requested Response:** [Date, ideally 2-4 weeks from send date]
- **Production Timeline:** [Estimated production schedule]
- **Planned Publication:** [Estimated publication date, if known]

### Alternative:

If full media assets are not available, I would appreciate:
- Confirmation that I may use UPS branding in a nominative fair use context (referencing UPS as the subject of the video)
- A link to any public press kits or media libraries
- Contact information for any UPS representatives who might be available for technical fact-checking (optional)

### Contact Information:

**Name:** [Your Full Name]
**Email:** [Your Email]
**Phone:** [Your Phone Number, if applicable]
**Website/Channel:** [Your Website or Channel URL]

Thank you for considering this request. I am happy to provide additional details or answer any questions about the project.

I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,

## Usage Notes

### Before Sending:

1. **Verify Recipient:**
   - Visit pressroom.ups.com or ups.com/media to find current media relations contact
   - Do NOT send to generic customer service or sales contacts

2. **Customize Template:**
   - Replace all [bracketed fields] with your actual details
   - Adjust tone and formality based on recipient (corporate media relations typically expects professional, formal language)
   - Include links to your previous work (if available) to establish credibility

3. **Attach Supporting Materials (Optional):**
   - One-page project summary
   - Sample of previous educational content
   - Preliminary script outline (if comfortable sharing)

### What to Expect:

- **Response Time:** 1-4 weeks (corporate media relations teams often have approval processes)
- **Possible Outcomes:**
  - ✅ **Approval with assets:** UPS provides press kit materials and usage guidelines
  - ⚠️ **Partial approval:** Brand guidelines provided, but no footage (common)
  - ❌ **Decline or no response:** Proceed with fair use strategy (stock footage + self-created graphics)

### If No Response After 3 Weeks:

- Send one polite follow-up email
- If still no response, proceed with **fair use approach**:
  - Use third-party stock footage (no UPS branding required)
  - Create self-made graphics referencing UPS nominatively
  - Ensure all claims are fact-checked and cited
  - Do NOT use UPS logos without permission (not required for editorial content)

### Fair Use Considerations:

Even without UPS permission, you can:
- ✅ Discuss UPS and ORION by name (nominative fair use)
- ✅ Show UPS trucks in stock footage or public settings (no endorsement implied)
- ✅ Reference UPS brand colors and identity descriptively
- ✅ Use publicly available data and press releases (with citation)

You CANNOT:
- ❌ Use UPS logos or trademarks in a way that implies endorsement
- ❌ Use proprietary UPS training materials or internal documents
- ❌ Misrepresent UPS's positions or make false claims

## Backup Plan (If Request Declined)

If UPS declines or does not respond, the production can proceed using:

1. **Stock Footage:**
   - Pexels, Pixabay, Artgrid: Generic delivery truck footage
   - No UPS branding required (editorial fair use allows discussion of UPS without using their logos)

2. **Self-Created Graphics:**
   - See `content/graphics/EP001-ups-orion-graphics-v2.md` (MVP tier)
   - All graphics can be created without UPS assets

3. **Public Sources:**
   - Use publicly available data from UPS investor relations, press releases, and case studies
   - Cite all sources clearly

**No UPS permission is legally required for educational/editorial content.** This request is a courtesy to potentially access higher-quality materials and ensure positive relationship with the subject.
