## Production Notes

### Shot Priority (Must-Have vs. Nice-to-Have):

**Must-Have:**
- Shots 1-4 (Cold Open establishing shots)
- Shot 6 (Factorial animation — critical to explaining complexity)
- Shot 14 (Data flow — critical to explaining how ORION works)
- Shot 16 (Dynamic routing animation — shows the upgrade)
- Shot 17 (Intersection overhead — explains right-turn policy)
- Shot 19 (Route comparison — counterintuitive math)
- Shot 22 ("Beat the Computer" — key change-management story)

**Nice-to-Have:**
- Shot 7 (Vintage footage — helps with storytelling but not critical)
- Shot 20 (Mythbusters — great validation but can use text card instead)
- Shot 13 (Engineers riding along — illustrative but can be implied through narration)

### Total Estimated Budget:
- Stock footage: ~$500-1,000 (depends on clips selected)
- Self-made graphics/animations: $0 (DIY) or $1,500-3,000 (if outsourced)
- Self-made footage: $0-500 (minimal costs for actor/driver if DIY)
