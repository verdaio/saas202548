## Production Notes

### MVP-First Philosophy:
- **Goal:** Produce a complete, clear episode with minimal assets
- **Strategy:** Prioritize shots that directly support key explanations (left turns, route optimization)
- **Fallback:** If a shot is difficult/expensive, use on-screen text or narration instead

### Extended Tier Strategy:
- **When to add:** After MVP episode is tested and approved
- **Priority order:** Add shots that most improve production value (vintage footage, distribution center, Mythbusters)
- **Budget:** Extended tier adds $500-2,000 in costs (archival footage, licensing)

### Self-Shoot Tips:
- **MVP-3 (truck interior):** Rent U-Haul or moving van for 1 hour, load with boxes
- **MVP-7 (waiting at intersection):** Film from passenger seat at any busy intersection
- **MVP-10 (driver + device):** Stage with friend/actor, use phone as stand-in for DIAD
- **MVP-12 (package delivery):** Film at your own doorstep

### Stock Footage Recommendations:
- **Free sources:** Pexels, Pixabay, Unsplash (video sections)
- **Paid sources:** Storyblocks, Artgrid (if free options insufficient)
- **Search terms:** "delivery truck," "package delivery," "office teamwork," "intersection traffic"
