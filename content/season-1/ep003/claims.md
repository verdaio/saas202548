## Claims System

### Critical Claims (Strict Sourcing Required)

Critical = numbers, precise dates, causality, safety/regulatory implications, or thesis-central.
- Require **two sources** OR a single authoritative primary that directly states it.
- Must have on-screen source tags if shown as a key-stat.

### Narrative Claims (Lighter Sourcing Required)

Mechanisms and framing that are not specific numbers/dates/causality.
- Require at least **one Tier 1 or Tier 2** source, or broad consensus.
- Still recorded here, but marked `Critical=NO`.

## Claims Table

| Claim | Critical? | Source 1 | Source 2 | Tier | On-Screen Tag? | Notes |
|-------|-----------|----------|----------|------|----------------|-------|
| [e.g., "UPS delivers 22 million packages daily"] | YES | [S1: UPS Annual Report 2023] | [S2: WSJ article] | 1, 2 | YES | Key stat, shown on screen |
| [e.g., "Routing optimization reduces fuel costs"] | NO | [S3: Industry report] | N/A | 2 | NO | Narrative mechanism |

## QA Checklist

- [ ] All Critical claims have 2 sources OR 1 authoritative primary
- [ ] All Critical claims shown on-screen have source tags
- [ ] All Narrative claims have at least 1 Tier 1/2 source
- [ ] All claims linked to `sources.md` entries
- [ ] No Tier 3 sources used for Critical claims

## Notes

- Purpose: Prevent research grind while maintaining credibility for what matters
- Critical claims are the highest risk; narrative claims allow faster scripting
