## Script Length & Timing

- **Word Count:** [Actual word count from script.md]
- **Target Length:** 15–20 minutes (flagship episode)
- **Actual Length:** [Fill after export]

## WPM CALIBRATION (CRITICAL — EP001 ONLY)

**Purpose:** Measure actual WPM for chosen voice to calibrate script length bands for all future episodes.

### Pre-Export Baseline (from Plan v2)

**Script Length Bands (LOCKED as baseline):**
- **15 minutes:** 2,000–2,600 words
- **20 minutes:** 2,600–3,200 words
- **25 minutes:** 3,200–4,000 words

**Assumed WPM:** ~150 WPM (including pauses)

### Post-Export Calibration (FILL AFTER EP001 EXPORT)

**Actual Measurements:**
- **Final word count:** [e.g., 2,350 words from script.md]
- **Final video length:** [e.g., 15 min 42 sec = 15.7 minutes]
- **Calculated WPM:** [word count ÷ minutes = e.g., 2,350 ÷ 15.7 = 149.68 WPM]

**Calibration Decision:**
- [ ] **Baseline accurate:** Actual WPM within ±5% of assumed WPM (145–155 WPM) → No change needed
- [ ] **Calibration required:** Actual WPM outside ±5% range → Update script length bands in Plan v3

**If calibration required:**
1. Calculate new word count bands using actual WPM
2. Document rationale for change
3. Propose Plan v3 update with new bands
4. Get Chris approval before updating plan

## Export Workflow Notes

### Pre-Export Checklist

- [ ] Script finalized in `script.md`
- [ ] TTS audio generated from script
- [ ] Audio imported into video editor
- [ ] Visuals (diagrams, maps, B-roll) prepared and imported
- [ ] Graphics overlays and source tags applied
- [ ] Style Constitution compliance verified

### Export Process

1. Generate TTS audio from finalized script
2. Import audio into video editor
3. Add visuals (existing EP001 assets: B-roll v2, graphics v2)
4. Apply graphics overlays and source tags
5. Export video with settings above
6. Upload to YouTube (as unlisted initially for QA)
7. Review captions and apply minimum corrections

### Post-Export Checklist

- [ ] Video exported successfully
- [ ] Actual length within target range (15–20 min)
- [ ] Audio quality verified
- [ ] Visual quality verified
- [ ] Captions generated and corrected
- [ ] **WPM calibration completed** (critical for this episode)
- [ ] QA checklist completed

## Notes

- **Existing EP001 Assets:**
  - Script v2: `content/scripts/EP001-ups-routing-script-v2.md` (~2,350 words, 15.5 min target)
  - Sources v1: `content/sources/EP001-ups-orion-sources-v1.md` (16 cited sources)
  - B-roll v2: `content/broll/EP001-ups-orion-broll-v2.md`
  - Graphics v2: `content/graphics/EP001-ups-orion-graphics-v2.md`
- **Integration Note:** Existing EP001 work can be referenced or migrated into this Season 1 structure
- **WPM Calibration Priority:** This is the ONLY episode where WPM calibration happens; all future script length estimates depend on this measurement
