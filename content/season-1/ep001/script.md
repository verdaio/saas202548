## Signature Frameworks Reminder

Every episode must cover these four sections (can be implicit in structure):
1. **What the system optimizes**
2. **Constraints that matter**
3. **Failure modes / where it breaks**
4. **Tradeoffs and who pays**

## Notes

- **Existing Work:** EP001 script v2 exists at `content/scripts/EP001-ups-routing-script-v2.md` (~2,350 words, 15.5 min target)
- **Integration:** Review existing script and migrate/integrate into this structure
- **WPM Calibration:** After EP001 export, measure actual WPM and update script length bands (requires Plan v3 version bump if changed)
