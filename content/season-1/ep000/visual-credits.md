## Rights-Safe Visual Sourcing SOP

### Default Visual Stack (in order of preference)

1. **House-made visuals:** diagrams, maps, icons, overlays (preferred)
2. **Public domain / government visuals:** with attribution
3. **Licensed stock:** only if license is clear and stored
4. **Company logos/screenshots:** limited, factual, used as identifiers, with attribution

## Visual Inventory

| Visual Description | Type | Source | License Status | Receipt Location | Attribution Required? | Notes |
|--------------------|------|--------|----------------|------------------|----------------------|-------|
| [e.g., "Diagram: Package routing flow"] | House-made | Internal | N/A | N/A | NO | Created in-house |
| [e.g., "Map: UPS facility locations"] | Schematic map | House-made | N/A | N/A | NO | Schematic, not tiles |
| [e.g., "UPS logo"] | Logo | UPS website | Fair use (factual ID) | N/A | YES (on-screen) | Used for identification only |

---

## Maps Policy Checklist

- [ ] Prefer schematic maps (pins/paths) over map tiles
- [ ] If using map imagery/tiles, license allows it and attribution is followed
- [ ] Map overlays are minimal (highlight flows, not detailed cartography)

---

## Logos/Screenshots Policy Checklist

- [ ] Used only when necessary to identify entities or show documented interfaces
- [ ] No endorsement implied
- [ ] Prolonged logo display avoided (keep it contextual)

---

## Receipts and Licensing Storage

**Media Warehouse Location:** `...\library\receipts-licenses\ep000\`

**Stored Items:**
- License links for all licensed stock
- Purchase receipts for paid assets
- Attribution requirements documented

**Repo Reference:** All receipts stored externally; `sources.md` includes "Visual credits" section linking to this file.

---

## QA Checklist

- [ ] All visuals accounted for in this file
- [ ] All licensed stock has receipts stored in media warehouse
- [ ] All logos/screenshots used for factual identification only
- [ ] All maps follow schematic-first policy
- [ ] Attribution provided where required
- [ ] `sources.md` includes "Visual credits" section

---

## Notes

- **Lite Episode Visual Policy:** Minimal rights risk visuals (house-made graphics preferred)
- **Target:** 2–3 diagrams + 1 map schematic
- Purpose: Prevent licensing issues and ensure attributions are clear
