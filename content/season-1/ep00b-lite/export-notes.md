## Emergency Export Notes (4-Hour Format)

**Purpose:** This is a buffer episode designed for 4-hour emergency export if a week breaks.

**Constraints:**
- Mechanism-heavy, low numbers (reduces research time)
- Strong diagrams (2–3 diagrams + 1 map schematic, all house-made)
- Minimal rights risk visuals (no stock footage or licensed assets)
- Shorter format (12–16 min vs. 15–25 min flagship)

**If Emergency Activated:**
1. Script already drafted (this folder)
2. Sources already gathered (`sources.md`)
3. Diagrams already planned (`visual-credits.md`)
4. Generate TTS audio (1 hour)
5. Create diagrams/map (2 hours)
6. Edit and export (1 hour)
7. Total: ~4 hours end-to-end
