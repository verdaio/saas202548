# Brand Guidelines

> Brand identity documentation for Case Study Library.

## Naming

This project uses two distinct names for different purposes:

| Type | Name | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| **Brand** (visual identity) | Case Study Library | Logo, assets, visual branding |
| **Channel** (content positioning) | Quiet Business Machines | YouTube channel name, content tone |

**Rule:** Do not rename logo assets when the channel name changes. Assets are versioned under `selected/v1/` and should remain stable. To update branding, create a new version (`v2/`) rather than overwriting.
