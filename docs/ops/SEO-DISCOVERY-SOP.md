## Examples

### Example: EP001 Description

```
Every day, UPS drivers navigate millions of routes optimized by an algorithm called ORION. This episode explores how the system works, why it's so hard to perfect, and what happens when algorithms meet real-world constraints.

What you'll learn:
• How UPS's ORION system optimizes delivery routes for millions of packages
• Why the "no left turns" rule isn't as simple as it sounds
• How drivers interact with algorithmic routing in practice

Key ideas:
• Optimization algorithms solve problems humans can't, but they need human judgment
• Constraints (traffic, time windows, truck capacity) matter more than perfection
• Real-world systems are always compromises between ideal and practical

• UPS 2023 Annual Report: [Link]
• "How UPS Delivers Faster Using '8 Weird Tricks'" — WSJ: [Link]
