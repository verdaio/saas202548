## Daily Minimum Habit

**15 minutes per day, no exceptions.**

Even on busy days, do at least one small action:
- Jot down a video idea
- Respond to a comment
- Read one relevant article
- Review one section of a script
- Watch a competitor video for research

The goal is momentum, not perfection.

## Adjusting the Rhythm

### Scaling Up (2 videos/week)

- Split Tuesday/Wednesday into two video tracks
- Consider batch recording on Thursday
- Requires more editing time Friday-Saturday

### Scaling Down (1 video every 2 weeks)

- Week 1: Research, outline, script
- Week 2: Record, edit, publish
- Maintain daily 15-minute habit

### Time-Crunched Week

If a week is unusually busy:
1. Prioritize: Can we still hit publish? If yes, compress tasks
2. Defer: Push publish to next week (rare, avoid habit of deferring)
3. Simplify: Shorter video, simpler format

## End-of-Week Review Rubric

Every Friday or Sunday, answer:

### What Worked?
- [ ] Which parts of production went smoothly?
- [ ] What content resonated (if reviewing past video)?
- [ ] What process improvements paid off?

### What Didn't Work?
- [ ] Where did I get stuck?
- [ ] What took longer than expected?
- [ ] What feedback was negative or constructive?

### What Will I Change?
- [ ] One specific process tweak for next week
- [ ] One content adjustment based on feedback
- [ ] One thing to stop doing

Log these answers in `tracking/episodes/episodes.md` under retro notes.

## Key Principles

1. **Consistency over perfection** — A published video beats a perfect draft
2. **Small daily actions compound** — 15 minutes/day > 3 hours once a week
3. **Review drives improvement** — Always do the retro
4. **Protect the publish day** — Don't let scope creep push the schedule
5. **Batch when possible** — Record or edit multiple videos if ahead of schedule
