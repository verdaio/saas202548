# Captions Minimum Standard

**Version:** v1
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-26
**Source:** Season 1 Plan Complete v2, Section 7

---

## Overview

This SOP defines the minimum captions correction standard for all Season 1 episodes.

**Purpose:** Ensure captions are accurate for accessibility and SEO, without spending excessive time on perfect transcription.

---

## Baseline Approach

**Use YouTube auto-captions** as the starting point.

**Do NOT manually transcribe** from scratch (too time-consuming).

---

## Minimum Correction Pass (REQUIRED)

**Time Target:** 5–10 minutes per episode (not optional)

### Required Corrections

1. **Names** (people, companies, places)
   - Example: "Ups" → "UPS"
   - Example: "Orion" → "ORION" (if acronym)
   - Example: "Bezos" → "Bezos" (if auto-captions misspelled)

2. **Acronyms** (ensure proper capitalization)
   - Example: "ups" → "UPS"
   - Example: "orion" → "ORION"
   - Example: "faa" → "FAA"

3. **Numbers** (ensure correct digits and formatting)
   - Example: "22000000" → "22 million"
   - Example: "twenty two million" → "22 million"
   - Example: "1974" → "1974" (verify year is correct)

4. **Meaning Changes** (captions that change the meaning of what was said)
   - Example: "not the best" → "now the best" (meaning reversed)
   - Example: "can reduce costs" → "can't reduce costs" (negation error)

---

## What NOT to Fix (Unless Obvious)

- Minor grammar quirks (e.g., "gonna" instead of "going to") — leave as-is if speakability matches
- Filler words (e.g., "um," "uh") — leave unless excessive or distracting
- Punctuation (auto-captions handle this reasonably well)
- Perfect sentence structure (captions don't need to be literary)

**Principle:** Captions should be accurate and accessible, not perfect.

---

## Process

1. Upload video to YouTube (unlisted or private)
2. Wait for YouTube to generate auto-captions (~5–10 minutes)
3. Open YouTube Studio → Captions → English (auto-generated)
4. Review and correct: Names, Acronyms, Numbers, Meaning changes
5. Save corrected captions
6. Verify captions in video playback (spot-check)
