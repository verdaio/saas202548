# Systemarium — Master Plan, Design, and Workflow v1
**Owner:** Chris
**Date:** 2025-12-23
**Status:** Execution-ready (v1)

---

## 0) Executive intent
Systemarium is a calm, advertiser-friendly educational YouTube channel publishing long-form "systems case studies" optimized for background listening **without** looking like mass-produced or reused content. The channel is built as an operational system: repeatable research → scripting → original visuals → QA → publishing → analytics feedback loop → compounding catalog.

**Core principle:** We optimize for **policy-resilient originality** first, then scale output.

---

## 1) Target outcome and measurable success
### 1.1 90-day outcomes
- Publish a credible **Season 1 foundation**: 12 flagship episodes + derivatives (shorts/condensed).
- Build a production pipeline that reliably produces episodes with:
  - unique thesis + bespoke outline
  - custom diagrams/timelines
  - sources + corrections policy
  - rights/licensing receipts
- Hit meaningful compounding signals:
  - watch hours accelerating week-over-week
  - returning viewers rising
  - browse + suggested traffic increasing share

### 1.2 180-day outcomes
- Monetization eligibility and approval (YPP ads), plus a second revenue stream (notes pack / affiliates / memberships).
- Sustainable cadence (no burnout): 1–2 flagships/week with batch production.

### 1.3 KPIs to track weekly
- Watch hours / week
- Average view duration (AVD)
- Retention at 10 min / 30 min / 60 min
- Returning viewers
- CTR by package (thumbnail+title)
- Claim rate (music/images)
- Limited ads rate / policy incidents

---

## 2) Positioning and scope
### 2.1 Channel promise
**Calm, long-form case studies explaining how real systems work—using original diagrams, timelines, and sourced research.**

### 2.2 What Systemarium is NOT
- Not "facts to sleep to" content mill
- Not a clip compilation channel
- Not a "AI voice reads Wikipedia" channel
- Not politically polarizing or rage-bait

### 2.3 Content lanes (choose 1 as the "Season 1 spine")
Pick one lane for Season 1; don't mix lanes until after traction.
1) **Operations & logistics** (recommended): ports, routing, inventory, airline turnaround, grocery replenishment
2) **Infrastructure & software**: DNS, browsers, databases, Linux governance, reliability patterns
3) **Standards & safety systems**: checklists, redundancy, incident learning, standards bodies (non-controversial)

**Decision:** pick the spine lane; other lanes become "Season 2" or "specials."

---

## 3) Season 1 content strategy (catalog architecture)
### 3.1 Season structure
- Season length: 12 flagship episodes
- Each episode: 90–150 minutes
- Each episode produces derivatives:
  - 1 condensed episode (12–20 min) for search
  - 3–6 shorts (15–45s) for discovery

### 3.2 Topic selection rubric (hard gate)
A topic is approved only if:
- we can cite **10+ credible sources** quickly
- it supports **8–12 chapters** without padding
- it allows **8+ original visuals/diagrams**
- it's **advertiser-friendly** (no gore/graphic violence; no extremist content; no harmful how-to)
- we can add a **unique thesis** (not just "what happened")

### 3.3 "Sub-niche gap" approach (how we win)
We win by combining:
- evergreen system (high interest)
- specific lens (low competition)
- calm case-study format (background listening)

Examples (Ops lane):
- "How grocery replenishment works (the quiet math behind shelves)"
- "Inside a port: why containers don't move faster"
- "UPS routing: constraints, heuristics, and exception handling"

---

## 4) Format design (what each flagship looks like)
### 4.1 Flagship episode template
- **Cold open (0:00–0:45):** "What system is this and why it matters"
- **System map (0:45–6:00):** components + definitions (diagram-heavy)
- **Chapters (6:00–end):** 8–12 chapters
  - each chapter: 8–15 minutes
  - each chapter includes:
    - one new diagram/timeline/map, OR a structured table visualization
    - "our synthesis": what we add beyond sources
- **Outro (last 60–90s):** recap + calm CTA ("playlist / next episode")

### 4.2 Tone constraints ("calm" without boring)
- no hype language
- no jump cuts / strobing visuals
- consistent pace (target ~120–150 wpm, validate by sample read)
- chapter transitions include natural pauses for ad-break points (no "ad calls")

### 4.3 Visual identity rules
- Prefer: diagrams, timelines, flowcharts, maps, simple charts
- Limit: AI art "mood" images (if used, keep consistent style and clearly licensed/generated)
- Avoid: reused stock loops, heavily repeated images across episodes
- Always maintain a credits trail (asset → license → attribution)

---

## 5) Policy and compliance guardrails (design for approval)
### 5.1 Originality signals (must be visible to a reviewer)
Each episode must contain:
- unique thesis sentence
- bespoke chapter outline
- minimum 8 original visuals (diagram/timeline/table/map)
- sources list in description + pinned comment
- creator note: what we researched + what we concluded
- corrections policy reference

### 5.2 Rights management (non-negotiable)
- No unlicensed music. Use:
  - self-made ambient bed, OR
  - explicitly licensed tracks with receipts.
- Images:
  - Prefer public domain / CC with compliance, or custom diagrams.
- Keep receipts:
  - license URL
  - screenshot of license terms if needed
  - attribution text
  - stored in episode folder

### 5.3 Sensitive content boundaries
Allowed: factual case studies, non-graphic incidents, neutral educational framing.
Avoid: step-by-step wrongdoing, exploitation, or anything that looks like instruction for harm.

## 6) Operating model (the workflow system)
### 6.1 The "Research → Script → Visuals → QA → Publish → Review" loop
**For every flagship episode:**

1) **Topic approval**
- run rubric (sources/chapterability/visualability/advertiser safety)
- assign episode ID

2) **Research packet (R1)**
- gather 10–20 sources
- extract claims
- build a claims table: claim → source → confidence → notes

3) **Outline (O1)**
- 8–12 chapters
- thesis per chapter
- visual plan per chapter (diagram list)

4) **Script (S1)**
- write chapter-by-chapter
- enforce calm pacing + transitions
- include "our synthesis" per chapter

5) **Visual production (V1)**
- create diagrams/timelines
- export images in consistent resolution
- ensure credits recorded

6) **Edit assembly (E1)**
- narration + visuals + minimal motion
- ensure audio consistency
- export master

7) **QA gate (Q1)**
- policy check
- rights check
- accuracy check (spot-check high-risk claims)
- metadata check (chapters, description, pinned comment, tags)

8) **Publish (P1)**
- upload with chapters
- add pinned comment (sources + corrections)
- schedule release time
- add to playlists

9) **Post-publish review (R2)**
- 24h, 72h, 7d check:
  - retention dips (where/why)
  - CTR (title/thumbnail adjustments)
  - comments (confusions, errors)
  - claims/copyright issues

### 6.2 Batch production schedule (prevents burnout)
**Weekly cadence option A (aggressive):**
- Mon–Tue: Research + outline (two episodes)
- Wed–Thu: Script + diagrams (two episodes)
- Fri: Record voice + edit (ep A)
- Sat: Record voice + edit (ep B)
- Sun: QA + publish + analytics review

**Option B (sustainable):**
- 1 flagship/week + 1 condensed/week + 3–6 shorts from backlog.

---

## 7) Content Ops repo design (assets, templates, automation)
### 7.1 Repo purpose
This repo is the operating system:
- episode scaffolding
- templates
- QA gate automation
- evidence + audit trail of rights and sources

### 7.2 Folder model (canonical)
- `episodes/season-01/ep-00X-<slug>/`
  - `00-brief.md`
  - `01-research.md`
  - `02-outline.md`
  - `03-script.md`
  - `04-visuals/diagrams/`
  - `04-visuals/images/`
  - `04-visuals/CREDITS.md`
  - `05-youtube-metadata.md`
  - `06-qacheck.md`
  - `exports/` (optional; local only; not committed)
- `templates/` (markdown templates)
- `docs/` (policy, style, rights, QA)
- `scripts/` (lightweight CLI)
- `artifacts/evidence/` (verification reports)

### 7.3 Automation: minimal CLI
Commands:
- `ops:episode:new` → scaffolds a new episode folder from templates
- `ops:metadata:build` → builds description/pinned comment blocks
- `ops:qa` → validates minimum requirements (sources count, credits present, forbidden terms, missing fields)

**Guiding rule:** automation helps compliance and repeatability, not "mass output."

---

## 8) Analytics and iteration system (how we compound)
### 8.1 What to optimize first
In order:
1) First 10 minutes retention
2) AVD and "chapter stickiness"
3) CTR (package testing)
4) Browse/suggested share

### 8.2 Standard iteration loop
Every week:
- pick the worst-performing retention cliff
- fix the root cause in next script structure (don't "patch" with hype)
- update templates if the fix is repeatable
- document changes

### 8.3 A/B testing discipline
- Test ONE variable at a time:
  - title vs thumbnail vs hook style
- Keep a log in `docs/EXPERIMENTS.md`:
  - hypothesis → change → outcome → decision

---

## 9) Monetization roadmap (policy-safe and diversified)
### 9.1 Phase 1 — Build catalog (0–90 days)
- focus on watch hours and viewer satisfaction
- no sponsor dependence

### 9.2 Phase 2 — Ads + affiliates
- affiliate links only to:
  - books referenced
  - learning resources
  - neutral tools (note apps)
- disclose clearly

### 9.3 Phase 3 — Notes packs / memberships
- "Systemarium Notes Pack: Season 1":
  - PDFs of diagrams + summaries + sources
- membership tier:
  - ad-free audio exports
  - early access
  - extended notes

### 9.4 Phase 4 — Sponsorships (only after stable baseline)
- pick sponsors aligned with education/tools
- avoid anything that risks advertiser suitability

---

## 10) Risk register (top risks and mitigations)
1) **Monetization rejection**
- Mitigation: visible originality (diagrams, thesis, citations) + strict QA gate + avoid repetitive formats

2) **Copyright/claims**
- Mitigation: receipts-first policy, licensed music, own visuals

3) **Burnout**
- Mitigation: batch production, strict templates, sustainable cadence

4) **Topic drift into sensitive/controversial content**
- Mitigation: topic whitelist + pre-flight advertiser-safety check

---

## 11) What happens next (sequence)
### Step 1 — Lock the spine lane (single choice)
Pick: Ops & logistics OR Infra/software OR Standards & safety.

### Step 2 — Bootstrap Content Ops repo (Systemarium OS)
- create repo structure + templates + docs
- implement CLI scaffolding + QA checks
- run verification + evidence report

### Step 3 — Build Episode 001 + Episode 002 using the pipeline
- pick two topics that strongly pass rubric
- run full process end-to-end
- publish and measure

### Step 4 — Iterate templates based on retention and production friction
- adjust scripts/diagram standards/QA gates
- document changes and update templates

---
