In this comprehensive tutorial, we walk through every step of building a production-ready authentication system. We start with project setup, then implement secure password hashing using bcrypt with a cost factor of 12. Next, we create JWT tokens for stateless authentication and implement refresh token rotation for security. The final system includes user registration, login, token refresh, and logout endpoints.
